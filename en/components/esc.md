# Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC)

An [electronic speed controller](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/electronic_speed_controller/) or ESC is an electronic circuit with the purpose to vary a servo-motorâ€™s speed, its direction and possibly also to act as a dynamic brake. ESCs are often used on motors essentially providing an electronically-generated three-phase electric power low voltage source of energy for the motor. It also allows much smoother and more precise variation of motor speed in a far more efficient manner than the mechanical type with a resistive coil and moving arm once in common use.
