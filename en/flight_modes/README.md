# Flight mode

There are 14 flight modes available in APM:Plane, 10 of which are regularly used.  You can set these up by doing the following:

+ Turn on your RC transmitter
+ Connect your board to Mission Planner or QGoundControl
+ Go to Flight Modes screen
+ Note as you move your transmitter’s flight mode switch (channel 5) the green highlight bar will move to a different position.
+ Use the drop-down on each line to select the flight mode for that switch position ensuring that at least one switch position is left assigned to Stabilize
+ When finished press the “Save Modes” button.
